    description:
      "Probability is the study of randomness and uncertainty, helping us understand the likelihood of different outcomes. It's the foundation for statistics and plays a crucial role in fields like data science, finance, and artificial intelligence. Whether predicting weather or modeling risks, probability is key to informed decision-making.",

    description:
      "Differential equations describe how quantities change in relation to each other, often over time. They are used to model real-world systems like population growth, motion, and electrical circuits. Engineers, physicists, and economists use them extensively to simulate and predict complex behaviors.",

      <p className="mb-4">
        Math sharpens your brain like a swordâ€”boosting critical thinking, logic,
        and problem-solving skills that help you tackle challenges in every part
        of life. It's not just about numbers; it's the secret language of the
        universe, powering everything from smartphone apps to rocket launches.
        Whether you're designing algorithms or decoding patterns in nature, math
        is the foundation that makes modern science and technology possibleâ€”and
        honestly, it's kind of like magic once you get the hang of it.
